Abstract With its strong seasonal variation in wave climate and various bathymetric features due to the complex
tectonics, the South China Sea (SCS) provides a natural
laboratory to study the microseism. We collected data from
seismic stations around the SCS and calculated their noise
spectra, through which seasonal and spatial variations of
microseism, as well as the general feature of seismic
ambient noise in this marginal sea were revealed. Microseism seasonal variations in general reflect influences of
the East Asian monsoon in winter and the Indian monsoon
in summer, respectively. The two microseism components,
the single frequency microseism (SFM) and the double
frequency microseism (DFM), show striking alternating
variation patterns both seasonally and spatially. These
variation patterns, along with the bathymetric feature near
the stations, indicate SFM and DFM are generated through
different physical mechanisms. More interestingly, seasonal and spatial variations of DFM appear to be consistent
with the basin-scale surface circulation model of the SCS,
in which the upper SCS experiences cyclonic in winter and
anti-cyclonic in summer. These consistencies provide
observational evidence for the hypothesis that the cyclonic
depression is a favorable condition to generate DFM..
