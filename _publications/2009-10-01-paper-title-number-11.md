Abstract: Current observational networks, climate models, and existing knowledge concerning climatic interactions and feedbacks as they relate to climate forcing and geomorphological processes in high-mountain environments are discussed. We emphasize the central Karakoram Himalaya in our discussion of radiation and precipitation forcing, climate-glacier dynamics, glacier erosion, and sediment transport. We highlight avenues for future research and note that an integrated, multidisciplinary approach is required in order to accurately assess climate predictions for the countries dependent on water from the receding high-altitude glaciers of the world.
