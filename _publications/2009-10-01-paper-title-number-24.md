excerpt: 'In this paper, we model decarbonization pathways for light-duty vehicle fleets in the U.S., China, and the U.K. through electrification. We use life cycle assessment (LCA) based GHG modeling and customized LMDI decomposition to evaluate emissions drivers across life cycle stages and countries, to inform effective decarbonization policy decisions.'

Abstract: Electrifying light-duty vehicle fleets is essential to decarbonize road transport, however its efficacy relies on policies targeting country-specific challenges and opportunities. We model and compare fleet-level life cycle GHG emissions for different grid scenarios and battery electric vehicle deployment timelines respectively in the US, China, and the UK from 2020 to 2050, cumulatively involving over one billion vehicles. A customized index decomposition analysis is employed to quantify the contributions of key emissions drivers. Results reveal that electrification can be effective for decarbonizing all three fleets, reducing over 50% of annual life cycle emissions by 2050. Priorities and challenges, however, differ across countries: The US fleet, which emits the highest GHGs, generally comprises older, heavier, and less fuel-efficient vehicles, would benefit the most from electrification and fleet modernization. Grid decarbonization and managing car ownership growth are critical for China, as its rapidly growing fleet and manufacturing rely on currently carbon-intensive electricity. The UK needs to expand its electricity generation capacity while electrifying its fleet. We also underscore the need for a comprehensive strategy, including electrification, low GHG intensity fuels, and moderating vehicle ownerships. This study highlights the importance of cross-country life cycle thinking to inform effective decarbonization policy decisions.
