Abstract: Geomorphometry, quantitative analysis and modeling of the land surface, is inherently multidisciplinary with a scientific foundation that involves complex multiscale interactions of processes and systems that govern terrain properties and organization. Fundamental principles of geomorphometry include data acquisition and modeling, characterization of surface properties and terrain objects, mapping, and topographic evolution. Issues of empiricism, scale, semantic modeling, process mechanics and indeterminate boundaries currently challenge the field. These issues may be overcome with improved digital representations, development of theory concerning scale and polygenetic evolution, semantic modeling, new parameters and analytical solutions, and innovative scientific visualization approaches.
