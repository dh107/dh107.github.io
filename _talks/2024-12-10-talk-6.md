The Local Emissions for Net Zero (LENZ) modelling suite is the City of Toronto's net zero energy system optimization model that includes a comprehensive representation of building, transportation, waste, and energy sectors. This talk will cover the structure and capabilities of LENZ, and showcase how the City can make informed decisions based on LENZ modelling results that are critical to meet its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets identified in the TransformTO Net Zero Strategy, and offer opportunities for the City to course-correct its actions and ensure alignment with the long-term goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2040.
