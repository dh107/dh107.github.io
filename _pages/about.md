Hi! I am Da Huo, a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University in the Department of Earth System Science. I am a geospatial data scientist currently working on greenhouse gas (particularly CO2) emission related projects. I am a member of the Carbon Monitor team, and the main developer of the Carbon Monitor-Cities dataset, which is the first near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset for 2000+ Global Cities.

My background and research
======
I received my Ph.D. degree in Geography (GIS and remote sensing) from Texas A&M University in 2020. I received my MSc degree in Geoscience from Rice University and BSc in Geophysics from Tongji University.

My doctoral research focuses on understanding glacier responses to climate change through numerical modeling and satellite remote sensing. I have worked at the Center for Geospatial Sciences, Applications and Technology at Texas A&M University where I developed remote sensing and geospatial applications to support carbon sequestration and bioenergy projects funded by the United States Department of Energy. I am also interested in the application of artificial intelligence in my field and have developed smarter feature detection and fleet dispatching algorithms using deep learning and reinforcement learning.

I have strong coding and data processing skills and experience in geographic information systems (GIS), carbon accounting, geophysical modeling, satellite remote sensing, statistics, and machine learning.
