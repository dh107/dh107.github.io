Hi! I am Da Huo, a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University in the Department of Earth System Science. I am a geospatial data scientist currently working on greenhouse gas (particularly CO2) emission related projects with the Carbobn Monitor research group. I am the main developer of the Carbon Monitor-Cities dataset, which is the first near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset for 2000+ Global Cities.

My background and research
======
I received my Ph.D. degree in Geography (GIS and remote sensing) from Texas A&M University in 2020. I received my MSc degree in Geoscience from Rice University and a BSc in Geophysics from Tongji University.

My doctoral research focuses on understanding climate-glacier sensitivity through numerical modeling. I improved existing models for more accurate simulation of glacier processes in the Himalayas. I have worked at the Center for Geospatial Sciences, Applications and Technology at Texas A&M University where I developed remote sensing and geospatial applications to support carbon sequestration and bioenergy projects funded by the United States Department of Energy. I have strong coding and modelling skills and experience in geographic information systems (GIS), geophysics, satellite image processing, spatial statistics, and machine learning.

Please check out other pages (publication, talks, teaching, CV) for more information.
