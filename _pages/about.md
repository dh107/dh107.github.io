Hi! I am Da Huo, a researcher working on climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. I am the lead developer of the Carbon Monitor Cities dataset (https://cities.carbonmonitor.org/), which is the first near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset for 1500+ cities. I am also modeling and comparing life cycle GHG emissions for vehicle fleets to guide decarbonisation policies.

I am also interested in assessing climate change impacts from a natural science perspective, including glaciers and ice sheets, natural carbon sinks and global carbon cycle. For my Ph.D. I studied glaciers in the Himalayas using physics-based numerical models and satellite remote sensing.

My background
======
I received my Ph.D. degree in Geography from Texas A&M University in 2020. I received my M.Sc. degree in Geoscience from Rice University and B.Sc. in Geophysics from Tongji University.
I am a Rising Stars in Clean Energy post-doctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, and I have worked as a post-doctoral researcher at Queen’s University and Tsinghua University.

Planetary health is the ultimate concern of my research, my recent work provide data, AI-powered tools, and quantitative analysis to support climate change science and mitigation strategies.

My research
======
* Modeling and comparing life cycle GHG emissions and decarbonization pathways for light-duty vehicle fleets in US, China and UK (University of Toronto)
* Developing OpenPit-AI: an AI-powered fleet management system for emission reduction in mining operations (Queen's University)
* Investigating relationship between electrification and low carbon transitions of cities (Queen's University)
* Leading the development of Carbon Monitor-Cities: the first near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset for cities worldwide (Tsinghua University)
* Leading a project on city-level carbon neutrality in collaboration with Alibaba Cloud
* Developing a ground penetrating radar data processing software for DOE (Texas A&M University)
* Studying climate-glacier dynamics using numerical simulations (Texas A&M University)
* Studying Earth ambient noise using data collected from ocean-bottom seismometers (Tongji University)
