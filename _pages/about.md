Hi! I am Da Huo, a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University in the Department of Earth System Science. I am a geospatial data scientist currently working on greenhouse gas (particularly CO2) emission related projects. I am a member of the Carbobn Monitor team, and the main developer of the Carbon Monitor-Cities dataset, which is the first near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset for 2000+ Global Cities.

My background and research
======
I received my Ph.D. degree in Geography (GIS and remote sensing) from Texas A&M University in 2020. I received my MSc degree in Geoscience from Rice University and a BSc in Geophysics from Tongji University.

My doctoral research focuses on understanding climate-glacier sensitivity through numerical modeling and satellite remote sensing.I have worked at the Center for Geospatial Sciences, Applications and Technology at Texas A&M University where I developed remote sensing and geospatial applications to support carbon sequestration and bioenergy projects funded by the United States Department of Energy. I am also interested in the application of artificial Intelligence in my field and have developed smarter feature detection and fleet dispatching algorithms using deep learning and reinforcement learning.

I have strong coding and modelling skills and experience in geographic information systems (GIS), geophysics, satellite image processing, spatial statistics, and machine learning.
