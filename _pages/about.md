Hi! I am Da Huo, a researcher currently working on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-related projects. I am a member of the Carbon Monitor team, and the lead developer of the Carbon Monitor-Cities dataset (https://cities.carbonmonitor.org/), which is the first near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset for 1500+ cities worldwide. I am also modeling and comparing life cycle GHG emissions for light-duty vehicle fleets in US, China and UK, to guide decarbonisation and EV policies.

My background
======
I received my Ph.D. degree in Geography from Texas A&M University in 2020. I received my M.Sc. degree in Geoscience from Rice University and B.Sc. in Geophysics from Tongji University.
I am a Rising Stars in Clean Energy post-doctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, and I have worked as a post-doctoral researcher at Queen’s University and Tsinghua University.
Planetary health is the ultimate concern of my research, my recent work provide datasets, tools, quantitative analysis to support low-carbon transition and the application of AI in decarbonisation.

======
* Item Modeling and comparing life cycle GHG emissions and decarbonization pathways for light-duty vehicle fleets in US, China and UK (University of Toronto)
* Item Developing OpenPit-AI: an AI-powered fleet management system for emission reduction in mining operations (Queen's University)
* Item Investigating relationship between electrification and low carbon transitions of cities (Queen's University)
* Item Leading the development of Carbon Monitor-Cities: the first near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset for 1500+ cities worldwide (Tsinghua University)
