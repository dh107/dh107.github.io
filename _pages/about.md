Hi! I am Da Huo, a researcher currently working on greenhouse gas (particularly CO2) emission-related projects. I am a member of the Carbon Monitor team, and the main developer of the Carbon Monitor-Cities dataset (https://cities.carbonmonitor.org/), which is the first near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset for 1500+ Global Cities. I am also investigating life cycle models to predict national electric and hydrogen fuel cell pathways for light-duty vehicle fleets, to meet climate targets.

My background and research
======
I received my Ph.D. degree in Geography (GIS and remote sensing) from Texas A&M University in 2020. I received my M.Sc. degree in Geoscience from Rice University and B.Sc. in Geophysics from Tongji University.

I have worked at the Center for Geospatial Sciences, Applications and Technology at Texas A&M University where I developed remote sensing and geospatial applications to support carbon sequestration and bioenergy projects funded by the United States Department of Energy. I am also interested in the application of artificial intelligence in my field and have developed smarter feature detection and fleet dispatching algorithms (for emission reduction) using deep reinforcement learning.

I have strong coding and data processing skills and experience in geographic information systems (GIS), carbon accounting, geophysical modeling, satellite remote sensing, statistics, and machine learning.
